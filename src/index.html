	<h2>How do you serve Doenjang Jjigae?</h2>
	<p>As with other Korean stews, the best way to cook and serve Doenjang Jjigae is in a Dolsot, which is a Korean stone bowl that is designed to keep your soups warm during the entire duration of your meal.</p>
	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<p>I highly recommend using stock as a base for your stew as it will yield the most flavorful results.</p>
	<p>Korean anchovy stock is incredibly easy to make using these convenient soup base packs, which are made in the form of teabags to add to your pot of water.</p>
	<p>If you don’t have any anchovy soup stock at hand, dashi stock or unsalted chicken broth or vegetable broth also make for great alternatives.</p>
	<p>Any leftover stew can be stored in the fridge for 3-4 days in an airtight container. To reheat, simply place in a pot and bring to a boil or microwave on high for 2-3 minutes or until heated through.</p>
